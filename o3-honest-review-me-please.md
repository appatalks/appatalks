## Am I a Hobbyist or a Professional Developer? 🤔

### 🗨️ Original Question
> Eva, I want an honest, non-bias review please.
> I’m looking at my [Credly public profile](https://www.credly.com/users/steven-bennett.eede0cba).  
> I’ve always thought of myself as a hobbyist programmer/developer because I never had formal training—I’m essentially self-taught.  
> Since I’ve earned multiple certifications, maintain my own Android app, and run various scripting projects, would I now be considered a **professional**, or does the **hobbyist** label still fit best?
